// Bitwise operators // data type modifiers

/*
& is known is bitwise AND operator. It is similar to && operator. but it can perform operations on the bits of a number
| is known as bitwise OR opeator . it works similar to || but it can perfor operations on binary of numbers
^ is known as XOR operator. if the value is true it gives 0 and if values are different it gives 1;
